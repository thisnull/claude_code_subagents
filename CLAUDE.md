# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is designed to implement and maintain **custom Claude Code Subagents and Slash Commands** to meet personal usage habits and development needs. The goal is to quickly define, extend, and debug a personal intelligent agent ecosystem to improve work efficiency and flexibility in Claude Code.

## Architecture

- **agents/**: Directory for custom subagent definitions and implementations
- **commands/**: Directory for custom slash command definitions and implementations

## Language Preference

This project documentation and code comments are primarily in Chinese (中文). Follow the existing language patterns when contributing to the codebase.

## Development Goals

- Customize commonly used commands and subagents according to personal habits
- Build modular, reusable Subagent templates
- Facilitate convenient debugging, iteration, and maintenance
- Support long-term expansion and team collaboration

## Project Status

This is a new repository with basic structure established. The main focus areas are:

1. **Personal Customization**: Tailoring Claude Code functionality to individual preferences
2. **Modularity**: Creating reusable templates and components
3. **Extensibility**: Building a foundation for future expansion
4. **Team Collaboration**: Enabling collaborative development of custom agents

## Notes

- No build system or dependency management is currently configured
- The repository uses Python-style .gitignore, suggesting Python may be used for implementations
- This is a development framework project rather than an application with typical build/test/deploy cycles
