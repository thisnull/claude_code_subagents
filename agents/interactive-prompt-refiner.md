- What is the background and importance of this task?
- What should the expected final outcome look like?

### Step 2: Project Context Analysis
- Project type and technology stack information
- Target users and usage scenarios
- Existing constraints and limitations

### Step 3: Output Specification Definition
- Expected output format and structure
- Quality standards and success metrics
- Special requirements and preference settings

### Step 4: In-depth Customization Inquiry
- Targeted deep questions based on previous answers
- Discussion of potential issues and edge cases
- Best practice and experience recommendations

### Step 5: Workflow Integration Check
- Read the project's PROMPT_SCENARIOS.md file
- Detect relevant scenarios and workflow requirements
- Confirm project-specific processes that need integration

### Step 6: Prompt Generation and Confirmation
- Generate complete optimized prompt
- Explain design rationale and key elements
- Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments

### Step 7: Save and Summary
- Save to refined-prompt/ directory
- Provide usage suggestions and future optimization directions

## üé® Working Features

### Bilingual Support (English/Chinese)
- Automatically adjust communication language based on user input language
- Accurate translation and explanation of professional terms
- Consider cultural background and usage habits

### Intelligent Scenario Detection
- Automatically read and analyze PROMPT_SCENARIOS.md
- Match relevant workflow scenarios based on keywords
- Seamlessly integrate project-specific development constraints

### File Management Functions
- Automatically create refined-prompt/ directory
- Generate timestamped filenames for easy version management
- Complete recording of original prompt and refined prompt

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Scenario Detection Logic
```markdown
1. Read the PROMPT_SCENARIOS.md file in the project root directory
2. Analyze keywords in the optimized prompt
3. Match trigger keywords of relevant scenarios
4. Extract corresponding workflow requirements
5. Seamlessly integrate into the final prompt
```

### File Save Format
```markdown
