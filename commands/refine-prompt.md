argument-hint: "<brief_prompt>" (the prompt you want to refine and clarify)
---

Transform your brief prompts into clear, detailed instructions and return them for your review and use.

**IMPORTANT: This command generates and displays refined prompts for you to copy and use - it does NOT execute the prompts.**

## Command Usage

```bash
# Generate refined prompt for authentication
/refine-prompt "Add user authentication"
# â†’ Returns detailed authentication requirements for you to copy

# Generate refined prompt for bug fixing  
/refine-prompt "Fix login issue"
# â†’ Returns detailed debugging steps for you to copy

# Generate refined prompt for performance improvement
/refine-prompt "Improve app performance"
# â†’ Returns detailed optimization requirements for you to copy
```

- Add input validation for email/username and password requirements
- Design user registration flow with email verification
- Implement "forgot password" functionality with secure reset tokens

Implementation Steps:
- Set up authentication middleware for protected routes
- Create user model with secure password storage
- Design login/logout API endpoints with proper error handling
- Add authentication state management in frontend
- Create user registration and profile management interfaces
- Implement proper session timeout and security headers

Quality Requirements:
- Write unit tests for authentication functions
- Add integration tests for login/logout flows
- Ensure HTTPS enforcement and secure cookie settings
- Document authentication API endpoints and usage
