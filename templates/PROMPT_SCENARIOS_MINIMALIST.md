## Feature Development
**When to Apply**: Building new features with MVP approach
**Core Principles**:
- **Start simple**: Build the minimum viable version first
- **Avoid complexity**: Don't add features "just in case"
- **Ship fast**: Get working software in users' hands quickly
- **Iterate based on feedback**: Let real usage drive improvements
**Best Practices**:
- Write just enough tests to ensure core functionality works
- Document only what users actually need to know
- Choose simple, proven technologies over cutting-edge solutions
- Defer optimization until performance becomes a real problem
- Focus on one feature at a time to avoid scope creep
**Common Combinations**: Often combined with Bug Fixing, Testing (minimal)

## Bug Fixing
**When to Apply**: Resolving issues with focus on speed and simplicity
**Core Principles**:
- **Fix root cause**: Don't just patch symptoms
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex fixes for simple problems
- **Ship quickly**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
- **Learn from patterns**: Notice repeated issues but don't over-engineer solutions
**Best Practices**:
- Write minimal tests to verify the fix works
- Document fixes only if they involve non-obvious business logic
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever optimizations
- Fix in production if it's faster than staging (with proper backups)
**Common Combinations**: Often combined with Testing (targeted)

## Code Review
**When to Apply**: Quick quality checks without bureaucracy
**Core Principles**:
- **Focus on correctness**: Does it work and solve the problem?
- **Readability matters**: Can someone understand this in 6 months?
- **No bike-shedding**: Avoid nitpicking on style preferences
- **Ship when ready**: Don't delay for minor improvements
**Best Practices**:
- Check for obvious bugs and security issues
- Ensure code follows basic project conventions
- Ask "Is this the simplest way to solve the problem?"
- Approve quickly if functionality is correct
**Common Combinations**: Often combined with Bug Fixing

## Testing
**When to Apply**: Essential testing without over-testing
**Core Principles**:
- **Test what matters**: Focus on business-critical functionality
- **Avoid test theater**: Don't write tests just to hit coverage metrics
- **Fast feedback**: Prefer quick manual testing over slow automated suites
- **User-focused**: Test from user perspective, not implementation details
**Best Practices**:
- Write tests for core business logic and edge cases
- Use manual testing for UI and user experience validation
- Skip tests for simple getters/setters and obvious code
- Run tests locally before pushing, skip CI/CD complexity when possible
**Common Combinations**: Often combined with Feature Development, Bug Fixing

- **Progressive enhancement**: Add new fields, don't remove old ones
- **User-focused**: Design APIs for ease of use, not theoretical perfection
**Best Practices**:
- Add new endpoints rather than modifying existing ones
- Use simple, obvious naming conventions
- Include basic examples in documentation
- Test API changes with real client code

## Database Changes
**When to Apply**: Database modifications with safety focus
**Core Principles**:
- **Safety first**: Always have backups and rollback plan
- **Incremental changes**: Make small, reversible modifications
- **Keep it simple**: Use standard SQL, avoid fancy database features
- **Data integrity**: Ensure data consistency but don't over-normalize
**Best Practices**:
- Test migrations on copy of production data
- Use database tools for migrations, not custom scripts
- Add columns instead of modifying existing ones when possible
- Keep old columns until sure new ones work
**Common Combinations**: Often combined with Feature Development, Data Migration

# üìä DATA & ANALYTICS

## Data Analysis
**When to Apply**: Simple analysis for quick insights
**Core Principles**:

- **Action-oriented**: Focus on insights that lead to decisions
**Best Practices**:
- Start with basic descriptive statistics
- Use simple visualization tools (charts, graphs)
- Document assumptions but avoid academic-level rigor
- Present findings in business language, not technical jargon
**Common Combinations**: Often combined with Performance Optimization

## Performance Optimization
**When to Apply**: Only when performance becomes a real user problem
**Core Principles**:
- **Measure first**: Don't optimize based on assumptions
- **Focus on user impact**: Optimize what users actually experience
- **Low-hanging fruit**: Fix obvious issues before complex optimizations
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Don't spend weeks optimizing minor issues
**Best Practices**:
- Use simple profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
